        - Cognito User Pool Authorization API
      description: >
       The Cognito User Pool Authorization API will be used by the user pool client to get auth token from Cognito. The auth token must be provided in the request header of the eligibility and bulk submission APIs to make an authenticated request. When used for the Eligibility Screening and Bulk Submission APIs, the Cognito Auth API will use the format required to exchange authentication credentials for an access token.
